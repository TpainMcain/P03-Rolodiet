## Installation Instructions
The application is live [here](https://good-eats-b2abe2613d0c.herokuapp.com/).
If you want to install this locally, download the repository, npm install, and replace the graphql endpoint with your localhost/graphql. then npm run develop will start the servers which you can access with a browser at localhost:3000/. Once this is done and the server has been started, you can seed the database by closing the server, entering cd server, then running node populateDb.js.
